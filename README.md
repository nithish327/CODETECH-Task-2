Project Title: Temperature and Humidity Monitoring with DHT Sensor


### Project Overview:
This project is focused on creating a system that monitors environmental temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor (DHT11 or DHT22) connected to an Arduino. The data collected by the sensor is then displayed on an LCD screen or viewed on the Arduino IDE's serial monitor.

### Key Objectives:
- **Measure Temperature and Humidity:** Accurately detect the ambient temperature and humidity levels using the DHT sensor.
- **Data Display:** Output the measured data either on a 16x2 LCD screen for standalone viewing or on the serial monitor for real-time monitoring on a computer.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously update the display with current temperature and humidity readings.

### Components Used:
1. **Arduino Board:** The microcontroller used to interface with the sensor and display the readings.
2. **DHT Sensor (DHT22):** The sensor responsible for measuring temperature and humidity.
3. **16x2 LCD Display (Optional):** Provides a visual interface for displaying the data, making the system independent of a computer.
4. **Breadboard, Wires:** Basic electronics components to connect the sensor and LCD to the Arduino.

### Working Process:
1. **Circuit Assembly:** Connect the DHT sensor to the Arduino along with the optional LCD display.
2. **Programming:** Write and upload code to the Arduino to collect data from the DHT sensor and display it.
3. **Data Monitoring:** The Arduino continuously reads temperature and humidity, updating the display or serial monitor in real-time.

### Applications:
- **Home Environment Monitoring:** Track indoor climate conditions.
- **Greenhouses:** Maintain optimal growing conditions for plants.
- **Weather Stations:** Collect and analyze local weather data.
- **Industrial Settings:** Monitor conditions in sensitive environments like server rooms or storage facilities.

### Learning Outcomes:
- **Sensor Integration:** Understand how to interface a sensor with a microcontroller.
- **Data Processing:** Learn how to process and format data for display.
- **Electronics Skills:** Gain experience in circuit assembly and troubleshooting.
